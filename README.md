# Python Games

If you have completed the League's [Python Apprentice](
https://python-apprentice.jointheleague.org/) class, you are ready to continue
your Python journey by learning to program games. 

To get started, either clone this repository to your local machine, or fork and
create a Codespace, then open the file
[lessons/00_Getting_Started/README.md](lessons/00_Getting_Started/README.md).
This will give you an overview of the module and how to get started.

The easiest way to get started is, from the [Python-Games Github Repo](https://github.com/league-curriculum/Python-Games), click on the green
![code](https://images.jointheleague.org/github/code_button_sm.png) button, then
select the 'Codespaces' tab, then
![ccom](https://images.jointheleague.org/github/create_codespace_sm.png). This
will create a codespace for you to work in, which has a web based IDE and all
the necessary tools to get started.

It's easiest to read the lesson documentation on Github; just click on the link
in the `Next Steps` section below, but you will also see all of the
documentation in your coding editor. 


## Next Steps

Open the file
[lessons/00_Getting_Started/README.md](lessons/00_Getting_Started/README.md) to
