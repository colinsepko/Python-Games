""" Turtle in Pygame

We really miss the turtle module from Python's standard library. It was a great
way to introduce programming, so let's make something similar in PyGame, using
objects. 

This program is for assignment 3 and 4

Assignment 3:

1. Read and run the program `01_Tom_the_Turtle.py` in this lession directory.
2. Create a derived class from the `Turtle` class that add some new behavior.
   Add a function `right` that turns the turtle to the right. ( Bonus, use the
   `left` function to implement the `right` function )
3. In your derived class, add a new variable `color` and a way to set it. Use
   that color to set the color of the turtle's line
4. Add a `pen_up` and `pen_down` function that will raise and lower the pen.

Assignment 4:

1. Create a function ( not a method, the function should not be part of a class) 
   in your `01_Tom_the_Turtle` program that takes a Turtle object and prints
   out the x and y position of the turtle.
2. Show that your function works by creating a turtle, moving it around, and
   then calling your function, for both the base `Turtle` class and your derived
   class.
