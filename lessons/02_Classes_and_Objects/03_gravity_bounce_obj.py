Gravity bounce in Object Oriented style

This version of the gravity bounce program uses an object oriented style to
organize the code. The main game loop is in the Game class, and the player is
a separate class. This makes the code easier to read and understand, and
allows for more complex games with multiple objects.

## Assignment 5

1. Open `03_gravity_bounce_obj.py` 
2. Review the program and try to understand how it works.
3. Change the program so that the player's initial velocity and position are set
   in the initializer to the `Player` class.
4. Add a color for the player, configurable in the initializer.
5. Add a second player to the game. The second player should be a different
   color and have different initial position and velocity.

When you are done, your program should have two player objects ( but only one
Player class!), of different colors, bouncing around in different trajectories.
