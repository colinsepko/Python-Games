# Motion and Physics

Our first lessons will be about how to move things around the screen and how to
use physics to make things move in a realistic way. We will start with the
simplest way to move things and then add more complexity as we go.

Open [00_Motion_and_Physics.ipynb](00_Motion_and_Physics.ipynb) to start the lesson.
